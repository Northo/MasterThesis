* Transitions for Type-II

We must calc the transitions for type ii

NB! Changing the sign of tz is not trivial as also the integration limits change. Probably better to do different signs separately

** 0 -> 1 [3/3]

*** DONE tz > 1

*** DONE tz < -1
Must be verified

*** DONE Verify
Yup, they are correct

** -N -> N+1 [2/3]

*** DONE tz > 1

*** DONE tz < -1

*** TODO Verify and unify expressions
