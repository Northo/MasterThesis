* Iron out the tz tilt
Check that we are well behaved when including eta and momenta cutoff
Make sure it makes sense to have mometna cutoff even for Type-I

* Go over the derivation of the x-tilt

** DONE Check the normalization factor \( \mathcal{N} \)

** TODO Make it clear what is the total contribution from T and J

** TODO Go carefully through the final expression, especially careful with the \alpha factors
