* Try to fix the divergences

Check the E0 E0 tz>0 transition once more

** DONE Introduce disorder
Let \( \eta \) be finite, and see if that helps.
I am pretty sure that it is correct to set \( \omega \) to zero before doing the integral.

** DONE Limit momenta
Read the paper about the limitation of the linear model
/Note/ According to that paper, the model should be good for low-angle situations.
Check that we do not diverge for small t.
