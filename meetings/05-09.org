* Stoof

** As the off-diagonal response is inherently dissipationless, we considered a clean s

** The response matrices from Eqs. (3), (5),
Why the antisymmetric response part

* Divergences
Looks like we get divergences
These are fixed by doing a momenta cutoff, however, I wonder if there is a more pure way to do it?
For example stoof have lots of divergences, but manage them

Diverge even for t << 1, which is troublesome

Also in graphene

* TODO Does tilt term break conformal symmetry
