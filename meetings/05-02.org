* How to unify the two definitions of parity inversion breaking?
Two and two of the nodes tilt the same way
* Breaking down of model for t ~ 1
See ferreirosAnomalousNernstThermal2017
* Divergence as t->1
Alireza noted that the terms \( 1/(\epsilon_m - \epsilon_n) \) looks like a Greens function.
I.e.
\[
\frac{1}{(\epsilon_m - \epsilon_n) (\epsilon_m - \epsilon_n - \eta)} ~ G^0 G^\eta.
\]
By taking \(\eta\) to be finite, we introduce scattering, which may solve this.

Also, Thorvald wants to look further into the breaking down of the linear model.
It might be that in the very region of the transition, the results behave strangely.
