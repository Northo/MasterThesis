* Minimal model and two cones
In the minimal model for Type II we have a 2x2 H with two momentum-separated cones.
If I understand correctly, we can extend the Hamiltonian to 4x4, and explicitly see the degeneracy of the spins.
Alternatively, we see that if the H is TR invariant, the spin flipped state is also an eigenstate??
So, are there really four cones in the minimal coupling, with two and two superimposed??
