* summary
** ... to house a new contribution to the Nernst effetct, whose origin confromal anomay
Emphasis that nernst is not from conformal


* Feedback on feedback
** TODO Landau Fermi liquid

- https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys2049.pdf

- Vozmediano video
  Says that Dirac/Weyl materials (including Graphene) does not comply with the Landau Fermi liquid paradigm

- Chernodub et al review
  "However, in the scale-invariant limit of vanishing density and temperature, all the parameters of the system reduce to dimensionless quantities and the Fermi liquid phenomenology can no more be used"


** DONE Schrodinger equation
Keep the name schrodinger equation for H psi = E psi , as chernodub does

** TODO Berry curvature def for degenerat

** DONE partial derivative prime
\( \partial '_i \)
