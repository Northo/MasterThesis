* Talk with Maria et al next week

** How exotic is this?
Which papers are relevant?

** Energy-momentum tensor

** Discussion similar to generation paper

** Tilt in y-direction

** Log \(\Lambda\)
Looked in Asgari paper (see [[file:05-30.org::*Effecitve fermi velocity from cutoff][Effecitve fermi velocity from cutoff]] )
Alireza seemed happy wiht \(\Lambda = \frac{k_c}{\sqrt{2 e B}} \) where \( k_c \propto 1 / a \).

* Physica print

** TODO Find out what the prices are and send to Alireza

* Draft
Did not really get a clear answer.
Should probably be more firm and ask for feedback on draft before some date.
