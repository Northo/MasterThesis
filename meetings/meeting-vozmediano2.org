* Reformulate modified pauli/gamma matrices as curved metric
- Reformulate the expressions with modified metric instead of introducing the tilt directly in the Lagrangian.
- Similar to how one mgiht absorb the Fermi velocity in the Minkowski metric to regain familiar form \( diag (-1, v_F, v_F, v_F) \).

  Specifially, consider the metric of tilted Weyl cone, so called, Painleve metric.
  See Volovik, G.E., 2016. Black hole and hawking radiation by type-II Weyl fermions. Jetp Lett. 104, 645â€“648. https://doi.org/10.1134/S0021364016210050

  The advantage of absorbing the tilt in the metric, is that we then may reuse the general results from GR.
  Is interesting to compare with what we got.

  /Thorvalds notes:/ For our computation in particular, I don't really think there is an intrinsic advantage in it, at least not for us less familiar with covariant calculations.
  However, it is interesting to see how the computations differ.

  Also: I think that, at least for the simple case, the calculations will be exactly the same, only a reformulation of where the t-vector lives.

* The energy-momentum tensor
The energy momentum tensor is the joker.
One important observation, is that as the tilt term breaks rotational symmetry, it might be more explainable/acceptable to use the non-symmetric energy-momentum tensor

Belinfante caputres /spin currents/.
Might be that the discrepancy between the canonical and dynamical choice is due to spin currents.

As opposed to ususal, where one in Luttinger considers fluctuations over minkowski, we must consider fluctuations over painleve

/Thorvald:/ Something Maria mentioned made me think of the discussion in Stoof, on how one relates the results found for symmetric and non-symmetric energy-momentum tensor.

* Type-II
In Type-II we seem to have non-zero density of states.
If it is finite, we have some length scale, and probably the response is not form conformal anomaly
/thorvald:/ for linear model, is DOS infinite? In that case, maybe we don't have a length scale?

In the same discussion:
The 0th LL is the 'star' of the calculation.
It is the only one which is truly scale independent, as the other LLs have dependence on the magnetic field strength.
So, the zeroth LL transition we expect are the 'true' scale anomaly behaviour.
(Ref fingerprints) the interval/gap where only the 0th LL exists, is where the true anomalous behaviour exists.
When going to type ii, this interval is non-existent.
Furthermore, the 0->+-1 transition interval, is finite, and so we have introduced some length scale
Probably scary to say that type-ii is anomalous
