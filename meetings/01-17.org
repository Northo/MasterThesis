* What should I do?

* Risk assessment
** TODO Alireza must do nothing, but I should probably make sure this is taken care of

* Is the contract fine?
** TODO Alireza had gotten the contract, I must check if I have received any emails

* Letter of recommendation
** More common that I put Alireza as a reference, and they contact him directly

* Crossing
** Type II SM
*** Is it possible to get an event horizon from another type of tilting term?
I expect not, but maybe.
That would mean that the material is somewhat non-linear (?) as we would have the behaviour of a diode.
We would also require two different states for each (upper/lower) cone, as for an event-horizon tilted cone the dispersion relation is not a pure function, i.e. not only one value for each k.

*** Type II in detail
+ History
+ Eigenvalue and states
  + Plot

+ Interpretation of the states dipping through the plane
+ Material
+ Possibly write about fermi arc?


** 2D systems
Graphene 2015 Kane: previously we open gap when magnetic field, now: gapless also when adding spin to the system.
"Dirac semimetals in two dimensions"
- Must write about the system
- Find out how we would include the conformal anomaly in that system

Will we still see the same effect in this system?
Neel vector can be added, which may open and close a tap in such systems.
