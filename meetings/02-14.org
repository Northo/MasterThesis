* Splitting of cones in tilted system
How does the Hamiltonian look like when we split the cones in a tilted system?
Which symmetries are broken etc.
This would necessitate extending to a 4x4 system, I believe

* Symmetries of H
Alireza wants to know the symmetries of H, P and T
Which symmetries are broken for nodal loop?
Maybe look at charge conjugation C and CT

* Remember to think about dimensionality

* PRL 118, 106402 (2017)
