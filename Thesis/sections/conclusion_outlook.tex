\section{Conclusion and outlook}


\begin{description}
  \item[Tilt parallel to temperature gradient]
        -Time constraints did not compute for tilt parallel to \( \nabla T \).

  \item[The energy-momentum tensor]
        - Still open question

  \item[Fully covariant calculation]
        - Move the explicit tilt parameter in the lagrangian into the metric

  \item[Finite chemical potential and temperature]
        Similar to doen ine sec
\end{description}
