\chapter{Conformal symmetry of a tilted system}
The origin of the term \emph{conformal anomaly} is the \emph{conformal symmetry}.
Under the conformal transformation, the massless \gls{qed} Lagrangian is invariant, as shown in the main text.
Specifically, the \gls{qed} Lagrangian
\[
\mathcal{L} = - \frac{1}{4} F^{\mu \nu }F_{\mu \nu} + i \bar{\psi} \slashed{D} \psi,
\]
with the usual \( \bar{\psi} = \psi^{\dagger} \gamma^0, \slashed{D} = \gamma^{\mu} D_{\mu}, D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu - i e A_{\mu}} \) transforms under the scaling
\[
x \to \lambda^{-1}, \: A_{\mu} \to \lambda A_{\mu}, \: \psi \to \lambda^{\frac{3}{2}} \psi,
\]
as
\[
\mathcal{L} \to \lambda^4 \mathcal{L}.
\]
The action \( S = \int \mathrm{d}^4x \mathcal{L} \) is thus invariant (as \( \mathrm{d}^4x \to \lambda^{-4}\mathrm{d}^4x \)), and the theory is classically manifestly scale invariant.

Consider now the tilted Dirac Lagrangian considered in our work,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:154}
  \mathcal{L} k i\bar{\psi} \Gamma^{\mu} \partial_{\mu} \psi,
\end{equation}
with \( \Gamma^{\mu} = \gamma^{\mu} + t^{\mu} \gamma_P \gamma^0 \), where \( \gamma_P = I_4 \) when inversion summery is broken and \( \gamma_P = \gamma^5 \) for inversion symmetric systems.
The tilt parameter \( t^{\mu} = (0, \vec{t}) \) is invariant under scaling, and thus also this theory is classically scale invariant.
