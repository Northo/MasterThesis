Topological materials have been of central interest in condensed matter physics for several decades~\cite{fruchartIntroductionTopologicalInsulators2013}, with the first topological phases arising in the context of integer quantum Hall effect~\cites{klitzingNewMethodHighAccuracy1980}[as cited in][]{fruchartIntroductionTopologicalInsulators2013}.
A solid understanding of the topological theory behind this has been developed during the last decade and a half~\cite{fruchartIntroductionTopologicalInsulators2013, bernevigTopologicalInsulatorsTopological2013}, with the Nobel Prize in Physics 2016 awarded for theoretical work on topological matter~\cite{NobelPrizePhysics}.
An excellent review of topological materials is given in~\cite{fruchartIntroductionTopologicalInsulators2013}.

One interesting phenomenon in topological materials is the emergence of quantum anomalies and their analogy to fundamental particles in quantum field theory.
Noether's theorem says that for any continuous symmetry of the action of a system, there is an accompanying conserved current.
This explains, for example, the conservation of momentum and energy as a result of the position and time independence of our universe.
In a quantum mechanical treatment, however, the symmetry of the classical theory may be broken, which gives rise to an \emph{anomaly}.
The chiral anomaly, for example, has been of great interest in condensed matter research in recent years~\cite{arjonaFingerprintsConformalAnomaly2019}.
The chiral anomaly explains the non-conservation of the axial current~\cite{zeeQuantumFieldTheory2010}, and gives rise to interesting transport phenomena in condensed matter systems~\cite{burkovChiralAnomalyTransport2015, wehlingDiracMaterials2014, burkovTopologicalSemimetals2016}.
A less investigated anomaly is the conformal anomaly, the appearance of a non-vanishing trace of the stress-energy tensor in a conformally scaled metric.
Transport from the conformal anomaly has recently been investigated and shown in Weyl and Dirac semimetals~\cite{chernodubAnomalousTransportDue2016, chernodubGenerationNernstCurrent2018, arjonaFingerprintsConformalAnomaly2019}.

In this thesis, we extend the Kubo calculation done by \textcite{arjonaFingerprintsConformalAnomaly2019} to find charge current response to thermal perturbations in \emph{tilted} Dirac and Weyl semimetals -- Lorentz breaking extensions of the Dirac equation.
The work combines important theory and concepts from both high energy and condensed matter physics.

The thesis consists of four chapters;
the three first chapters introduce concepts central to the main derivation of the thesis, while the fourth chapter represents the bulk work of the thesis, namely the derivation of the transverse charge current response from thermal perturbations in tilted Dirac and Weyl semimetals.
Note that some sections of the first and second chapter, and most of the third chapter, started as parts of a specialization project report written in the fall of 2021.

The first chapter gives an overview of concepts important to topological materials, starting with symmetries and ending with a more in-depth discussion of Weyl and Dirac semimetals, with a special focus on the tilted type.
In the second chapter, linear responses theory is introduced in light of the Kubo formalism and the Luttinger formalism of thermal transport.
In chapter three, we introduce anomalies in the context of high energy quantum field theory.
The thesis also contains some appendices;
\cref{cha:long_expression} contains long expressions not included in the main text, \cref{sec:otherterm-appendix} contains a lengthy calculation that runs somewhat in parallel to the main text, for an alternative choice of the energy-momentum tensor (details discussed in the main text), and lastly, \cref{sec:aux-appendix} contains several minor results the author finds interesting, that are only tangentially relevant to the main work.


% The thesis consists of four chapters;

% The fourth chapter is the derivation of the response function, combining all the previous concepts.
