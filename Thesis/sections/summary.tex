This thesis constitutes the final part of a ``Sivilingeniør'' (M.Sc.) degree in Physics and Mathematics at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.
It was written during the spring of 2022, after a five year study program.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Alireza Qaiumzadeh, for excellent guidance through this last year.
This has been a novel topic for the both of us, and our weekly meetings have been filled with interesting discussions and conversations.

Furthermore, I want to thank
\href{https://wp.icmm.csic.es/field-theories-in-condensed-matter-physics/vozmediano/}{María A. H. Vozmediano}\footnote{Materials Science Factory, Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid, CSIC, Cantoblanco, 28049 Madrid, Spain\label{address-of-spain}}
and
\href{https://wp.icmm.csic.es/field-theories-in-condensed-matter-physics/alberto-cortijo/}{Alberto Cortijo}\footnotemark[1]
for excellent discussions during the finalization of the thesis.
Through our meetings the significance and interpretation of the results was made more clear, and interesting questions and continuations discussed.
It was also reassuring to hear that you had struggled with some of the same issues that we had faced.

The work presented in this thesis is currently being worked into a manuscript written primarily by me and Alireza, in collaboration with Maria and Alberto.
