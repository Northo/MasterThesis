\chapter{Topological materials}
In this chapter, we consider various concepts from physics that are relevant in the context of topological materials.
Firstly, the symmetry related concepts of parity, time reversal, Kramer's degeneracy, and accidental degeneracy are explained.
Then, the concept of linear dispersion in Weyl and Dirac cones is discussed, along with some useful results.
Lastly follows a quick summary of spin-orbit interactions.
The chapter is intended as a quick introduction to the vast field of topological materials for someone who are not familiar with these concepts.

Some topics discussed are directly applicable to the thesis, while others are included both in order to put the concepts of the thesis in a greater context, and also with regards to further continuation of this work.

% \section{Discussion of results}
% \todo{Old, from specialization project}
% In the static and local limit $\lim_{\omega \to 0} \lim_{\vec{q}\to 0}$ the  transverse response function $\chi^{xy}$ of the charge current to a temperature perturbation
% \begin{equation}
%   J^x = \chi ^{xy} \frac{- \nabla^y T}{T}
% \end{equation}
% from a single Dirac point was found  to be
% \begin{equation}
%   \lim_{\omega \to 0} \lim_{\vec{q}\to 0}
%   \chi ^{xy}
%   =
%   \gamma_{N}
%   \frac{e^2 B v_F}{4 (2\pi )^2 \hbar },
% \end{equation}
% with $\gamma _N$ a prefactor dependent on how many landau levels are included in the final evaluation of the response function.
% The response function is independent of the chirality $s$ of the Dirac point.
% It was found that $\gamma _0 = 1, \gamma _{20} \approx 2$ and that the prefactor goes like $\log N$.

% % Firstly, the result differ slightly from that found by~\textcite{arjonaFingerprintsConformalAnomaly2019}
% % \begin{equation}
% %   \lim_{\omega \to 0} \lim_{\vec{q}\to 0}
% %   \chi ^{xy}
% %   =
% %   2 \gamma_{N}
% %   \frac{e^2 B v_F}{4 (2\pi )^2 \hbar },
% % \end{equation}
% % which differ by a factor of two.

% Secondly, the sum will diverge as $N\to \infty $.
% However, not all Landau levels are filled, and thus the sum should not be taken to all levels.
% Similarly to a Quantum Hall effect, the number of filled bands, the filling factor $\nu $, is inverse proportional to the $B$-field strength
% \begin{equation}
%   \nu \propto \frac{1}{B}.
% \end{equation}
% Thus, we expect that the $N$-sum should be truncated at a Landau level, given by the filling factor $\nu $.
% A detailed derivation of the exact truncation of the $N$-sum has not been done.
% If a precise result for the numerical prefactor is found to be of importance, this should be straightforward.

% The divergence is not discussed by~\citeauthor{arjonaFingerprintsConformalAnomaly2019}, where only the values of $N = 0$ and  $N=20$ are given, and the final result is that of $N=20$.
% Furthermore, they state that the contributions from higher values of $N$ decrease very rapidly.
% However, we found the contributions to go like $1 /x$, which is not decreasing rapidly enough to give a finite total contribution, thus giving the total contribution diverging logarithmically.
% \todo{Say that we are communicating with them  to better understand their choice of truncation?}
% Comparing our result with the different procedure done by~\citeauthor{chernodubGenerationNernstCurrent2018}~\cite{chernodubGenerationNernstCurrent2018}, the numerical prefactor found in our calculation including only the first term ($M=0$) coincides very well with the numerical prefactor found there, with a ratio of $16 / 18$.
