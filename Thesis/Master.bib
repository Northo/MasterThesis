  abstract = {In a recent work, a contribution to the Nernst current of a Dirac or Weyl semimetal coming from the conformal anomaly was reported. Being originated from an anomaly - a vacuum contribution -, a non-zero transport coefficient was predicted at zero temperature and chemical potential. In this work we perform a Kubo formula calculation of the thermoelectrical coefficient and confirm that the result agrees with the quantum field theory estimation in the limit of zero temperature and chemical potential. For finite chemical potential \{\textbackslash mu\} around \{\textbackslash mu\} = 0 the transverse Seebeck coefficient shows a plateau indicating that only the zero conformal Landau levels contributes to this intrinsic effect. This result opens the way to the experimental observation of a geometric anomaly which is much harder to explore than the standard chiral anomaly.},

  abstract = {This thesis studies some aspects of the physics of topological semimetals, a set of
 novel three-dimensional matter systems whose low-energy electronic excitations are
 described by Dirac quasiparticles. The unconventional features of these materials,
 ranging from basic physics to technological applications, have generated a substantial
 research activity during the last years. The interest in crystalline structures
 hosting Dirac quasiparticles lies partially on the relativistic nature of their electronic
 degrees of freedom, making them an ideal laboratory to test and study fundamental
 physics phenomena. This thesis addresses two topics of major interest in the
 physics of these systems: the interplay between lattice deformations and electronic
 properties, and the influence of anomalies on the thermoelectric response.
 In the first part of this thesis, the thermoelectric response of Dirac and Weyl
 semimetals is studied in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The anomalous
 thermoelectric behaviour is addressed at the charge neutrality point, where a finite
 contribution to the thermoelectric coefficient is obtained in the conformal limit.
 The thermoelectric coefficients fulfill robust phenomenological relations based
 on the Landau-Fermi liquid paradigm of coherent quasiparticles. These relations
 may be challenged when the system has strong interactions or when it presents a
 poor metallic behaviour. The validity of the Mott relation, a phenomenological law
 that relates the thermopower and the electrical conductivity coefficients, is discussed
 in the regime of zero doping and zero temperature. In particular, the off-diagonal
 components of the electric and thermoelectric tensors are analyzed in the presence
 of a magnetic field.
 The influence of external deformations on the lattice configuration of topological
 semimetals is essential to understand their electronic properties. In these systems,
 elastic deformations couple to the low-energy electronic excitations in the form
 of elastic gauge fields. The possibility of controlling the dynamics of carriers by
 appropriate strain geometries has given rise to a prolific industry associated with
 straintronics. In the second part of this thesis, the coupling of lattice deformations to
 Dirac quasiparticles in three-dimensional materials is studied by using a symmetry
 approach. An interesting aspect is that, in contrast to the two-dimensional case, the
 antisymmetric part of the deformation tensor couple to the electronic excitations in
 three-dimensional Dirac materials. Finally, the interplay between electromagnetic fields and elastic deformations is
 also discussed, in which the collapse of Landau levels is showed in the presence of
 strain. The similarities of this mechanism with the case of real magnetic and electric
 fields are emphasized, discussing possible strain configurations giving rise to this
 effect.},

In the dimensionally reduced theory, the chiral magnetic effect is directly related to the relativistic form of the Peierls instability, leading to a spiral form of the condensate, the chiral magnetic spiral. We then discuss the competition between spin projection, due to a strong magnetic field, and chirality projection, due to an instanton, for light fermions in QCD and QED.

The book begins with simple concepts such as Berry phases, Dirac fermions, Hall conductance and its link to topology, and the Hofstadter problem of lattice electrons in a magnetic field. It moves on to explain topological phases of matter such as Chern insulators, two- and three-dimensional topological insulators, and Majorana p-wave wires. Additionally, the book covers zero modes on vortices in topological superconductors, time-reversal topological superconductors, and topological responses/field theory and topological indices. The book also analyzes recent topics in condensed matter theory and concludes by surveying active subfields of research such as insulators with point-group symmetries and the stability of topological semimetals. Problems at the end of each chapter offer opportunities to test knowledge and engage with frontier research issues.

An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of Ĥ(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of Ĥ, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.}

  abstract = {These lectures on anomalies are relatively self-contained and intended for graduate students who are familiar with the basics of quantum field theory. We begin with several derivations of the abelian anomaly: anomalous transformation of the measure, explicit computation of the triangle Feynman diagram, relation to the index of the Euclidean Dirac operator. The chiral (non-abelian) gauge anomaly is derived by evaluating the anomalous triangle diagram with three non-abelian gauge fields coupled to a chiral fermion. We discuss in detail the relation between anomaly, current non-conservation and non-invariance of the effective action, with special emphasis on the derivation of the anomalous Slavnov-Taylor/Ward identities. We show why anomalies always are finite and local. A general characterization is given of gauge groups and fermion representations which may lead to anomalies in four dimensions, and the issue of anomaly cancellation is discussed, in particular the classical example of the standard model. Then, we move to more formal developments and arbitrary even dimensions. After introducing a few basic notions of differential geometry, in particular characteristic classes, we derive the descent equations. We prove the Wess-Zumino consistency condition and show that relevant anomalies correspond to BRST cohomologies at ghost number one. We discuss why and how anomalies are related to characteristic classes in two more dimensions and outline their computation in terms of the index of an appropriate Dirac operator. Finally we derive the gauge and gravitational anomalies in arbitrary even dimensions from the appropriate index and explain the anomaly cancellations in ten-dimensional IIB supergravity and in type I and heterotic superstrings.},

  abstract = {We present an overview of our recent work on transport phenomena in Weyl metals, which may be connected to their nontrivial topological properties, particularly to chiral anomaly. We argue that there are two basic phenomena, which are related to chiral anomaly in Weyl metals: anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and chiral magnetic effect (CME). While AHE is in principle present in any ferromagnetic metal, we demonstrate that a magnetic Weyl metal is distinguished from an ordinary ferromagnetic metal by the absence of the extrinsic and the Fermi surface part of the intrinsic contributions to the AHE, as long as the Fermi energy is sufficiently close to the Weyl nodes. The AHE in a Weyl metal is thus shown to be a purely intrinsic, universal property, fully determined by the location of the Weyl nodes in the first Brillouin zone. In other words, a ferromagnetic Weyl metal may be thought of as the only example of a ferromagnetic metal with a purely intrinsic AHE. We further develop a fully microscopic theory of diffusive magnetotransport in Weyl metals. We derive coupled diffusion equations for the total and axial (i.e. node-antisymmetric) charge densities and show that chiral anomaly manifests as a magnetic-field-induced coupling between them. We demonstrate that an experimentally-observable consequence of CME in magnetotransport in Weyl metals is a quadratic negative magnetoresistance, which will dominate all other contributions to magnetoresistance under certain conditions and may be regarded as a smoking-gun transport characteristic, unique to Weyl metals.},

  abstract = {We present a study of "nodal semimetal" phases, in which non-degenerate conduction and valence bands touch at points (the "Weyl semimetal") or lines (the "line node semimetal") in three-dimensional momentum space. We discuss a general approach to such states by perturbation of the critical point between a normal insulator (NI) and a topological insulator (TI), breaking either time reversal (TR) or inversion symmetry. We give an explicit model realization of both types of states in a NI--TI superlattice structure with broken TR symmetry. Both the Weyl and the line-node semimetals are characterized by topologically-protected surface states, although in the line-node case some additional symmetries must be imposed to retain this topological protection. The edge states have the form of "Fermi arcs" in the case of the Weyl semimetal: these are chiral gapless edge states, which exist in a finite region in momentum space, determined by the momentum-space separation of the bulk Weyl nodes. The chiral character of the edge states leads to a finite Hall conductivity. In contrast, the edge states of the line-node semimetal are "flat bands": these states are approximately dispersionless in a subset of the two-dimensional edge Brillouin zone, given by the projection of the line node onto the plane of the edge. We discuss unusual transport properties of the nodal semimetals, and in particular point out quantum critical-like scaling of the DC and optical conductivity of the Weyl semimetal, and similarities to the conductivity of graphene in the line node case.},

  abstract = {We show that the scale (conformal) anomaly in field theories leads to new anomalous transport effects that emerge in an external electromagnetic field in an inhomogeneous gravitational background. In inflating geometry the QED scale anomaly locally generates an electric current that flows in opposite direction with respect to background electric field (the scale electric effect). In a static spatially inhomogeneous gravitational background the dissipationless electric current flows transversely both to the magnetic field axis and to the gradient of the inhomogeneity (the scale magnetic effect). The anomalous currents are proportional to the beta function of the theory.},

  abstract = {Quantum polarization effects associated with the conformal anomaly in a static magnetic field background may generate a transverse electric current in the vacuum. The current may be produced either in an unbounded curved spacetime or in a flat spacetime in a physically bounded system. In both cases, the magnitude of the electric current is proportional to the beta-function associated with renormalization of the electric charge. In our article, we investigate the electric current density induced by the magnetic field in the vicinity of a Dirichlet boundary in the scalar QED. Using first-principle lattice simulations we show that the electric current, generated by this `conformal magnetic effect at the edge' (CMEE), is well described by the conformal anomaly provided the conformal symmetry is classically unbroken. Outside of the conformal limit, the current density is characterized by an anomalous power law near the edge of the system and by an exponential suppression of the current far away from the edge.},

  abstract = {The Scale Magnetic Effect (SME) is the generation of electric current due to conformal anomaly in external magnetic field in curved spacetime. The effect appears in a vacuum with electrically charged massless particles. Similarly to the Hall effect, the direction of the induced anomalous current is perpendicular to the direction of the external magnetic field \$\textbackslash bf B\$ and to the gradient of the conformal factor \$\textbackslash tau\$, while the strength of the current is proportional to the beta function of the theory. In massive electrodynamics the SME remains valid, but the value of the induced current differs from the current generated in the system of massless fermions. In the present paper we use the Wigner--Weyl formalism to demonstrate that in accordance with the decoupling property of heavy fermions the corresponding anomalous conductivity vanishes in the large-mass limit with \$m\^2 \textbackslash gg |e \{\textbackslash bf B\}|\$ and \$m \textbackslash gg |\textbackslash nabla \textbackslash tau|\$.},

  abstract = {Spin Hall effects are a collection of phenomena, resulting from spin-orbit coupling, in which an electrical current flowing through a sample can lead to spin transport in a perpendicular direction and spin accumulation at lateral boundaries. These effects, which do not require an applied magnetic field, can originate in a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic spin-orbit coupling mechanisms and depend on geometry, dimension, impurity scattering, and carrier density of the system—making the analysis of these effects a diverse field of research. In this article, we give an overview of the theoretical background of the spin Hall effects and summarize some of the most important results. First, we explain effective spin-orbit Hamiltonians, how they arise from band structure, and how they can be understood from symmetry considerations; including intrinsic coupling due to bulk inversion or structure asymmetry or due to strain, and extrinsic coupling due to impurities. This leads to different mechanisms of spin transport: spin precession, skew scattering, and side jump. Then we present the kinetic (Boltzmann) equations, which describe the spin-dependent distribution function of charge carriers, and the diffusion equation for spin polarization density. Next, we define the notion of spin currents and discuss their relation to spin polarization. Finally, we explain the electrically induced spin effects; namely, spin polarization and currents in bulk and near boundaries (the focus of most current theoretical research efforts), and spin injection, as well as effects in mesoscopic systems and in edge states.},

For inversion symmetric tilt, we give analytic expressions in two opposite limits: For a small tilt, corresponding to a type-I Weyl semimetal, the Nernst conductivity is finite and independent of the Fermi level; for a large tilt, corresponding to a type-II Weyl semimetal, it acquires a contribution depending logarithmically on the Fermi energy. This result is in a sharp contrast to the nontilted case, where the Nernst response is known to be zero in the linear model. The thermal Hall conductivity similarly acquires Fermi surface contributions, which add to the Fermi level-independent, zero-tilt result, and is suppressed as one over the tilt parameter at half filling in the type-II phase. In the case of inversion-breaking tilt, with the tilting vector of equal modulus in the two Weyl cones, all Fermi surface contributions to both anomalous responses cancel out, resulting in zero Nernst conductivity. We discuss two possible experimental setups, representing open and closed thermoelectric circuits.},

The necessity of ``improving'' the expressions provided by the canonical Noether procedure is addressed and given an adequate geometric framework. The main new ingredient is the explicit formulation of a principle of ``ultralocality'' with respect to the symmetry generators, which is shown to fix the ambiguity inherent in the procedure of improvement and guide it towards a unique answer: when combined with the appropriate splitting of the fields into sectors, it leads to the well-known expressions for the current as the variational derivative of the matter field Lagrangian with respect to the gauge field and for the energy-momentum tensor as the variational derivative of the matter field Lagrangian with respect to the metric tensor. In the second case, the procedure is shown to work even when the matter field Lagrangian depends explicitly on the curvature, thus establishing the correct relation between scale invariance, in the form of local Weyl invariance ``on shell'', and tracelessness of the energy-momentum tensor, required for a consistent definition of the concept of a conformal field theory.},

The ensemble of valence bands is then a well defined object, which can possess non-trivial or twisted topological properties. In the case of a twisted topology, the insulator is called a topological insulator. We introduce this notion of topological order in insulators as an obstruction to define the Bloch wave functions over the whole Brillouin Zone using a single phase convention. Several simple historical models displaying a topological order in dimension two are considered. Various expressions of the corresponding topological index are finally discussed.},

  abstract = {Topological semimetals have recently attracted great attention due to prospective applications governed by their peculiar Fermi surfaces. Weyl semimetals host chiral fermions that manifest as pairs of non-degenerate massless Weyl points in their electronic structure, giving rise to novel macroscopic quantum phenomena such as the chiral anomaly, an unusual magnetoresistance, and various kinds of Hall effects These properties enable the engineering of non-local electric transport devices, magnetic sensors and memories, and spintronics devices. Nevertheless, little is known about the underlying spin- and orbital-degrees of freedom of the electron wave functions in Weyl semimetals, that govern the electric transport. Here, we give evidence that the chirality of the Weyl points in the Type-II Weyl semimetal MoTe\$\_2\$ is directly linked to the spin texture and orbital angular momentum of the electron wave functions. By means of state-of-the-art spin- and momentum-resolved photoemission spectroscopy the spin- and orbital texture in the Fermi surface is directly resolved. Supported by first-principles calculations, we examined the relationship between the topological chiral charge and spin texture, which significantly contributes to the understanding of the electronic structure in topological quantum materials.},

It is found that coincidence of the energies of wave functions with the same symmetry properties, as well as those with different symmetries, is often to be expected. Some qualitative features are derived of the way in which energy varies with wave vector near wave vectors for which degeneracy occurs. All these results, like those of the preceding paper, should be applicable also to the frequency spectrum of the normal modes of vibration of a crystal.},

  abstract = {The completion of quantum Hall trio, namely the quantum Hall effect (QHE), the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), and the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), has greatly broadened our understandings about the electron movement in solids. Likewise, the discovered scale-invariant dissipationless conduction in these three quantum transport states has inspired us to the development of practical low-power-consumption electronics/spintronics applications. In this review article, we outline the fundamental physics and relations between different Hall effects. In general, QSHE is a result of band inversion due to the large spin-orbit coupling; since the time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is well-protected in such QSH insulators, helical edge states with both spin-up and spin-down electrons are allowed and the conduction is immune to non-magnetic impurities. On the other hand, when TRS is broken by either perpendicular magnetic field or magnetic order, helical edge states are reduced to the single chiral channel, which in turn gives rise to QHE and QAHE, and backscattering from any impurity is strictly forbidden owing to the nature of chirality. Moreover, the interplay between this quantum Hall trio in certain conditions unveils new ways to explore emerging chiral materials and related quantum phenomena.},

We find that the thermal conductivity and thermopower have an interesting dependence on the chemical potential that is characteristic of the linear electronic dispersion, and that the electron-electron interactions modify the Lorenz number. For the interacting system, we also use the Kubo formalism to obtain the transport coefficients. We find exact agreement between the Kubo and Boltzmann approaches at high temperatures. We also consider the effect of electric and magnetic fields on the thermal conductivity in various orientations with respect to the temperature gradient. Notably, when the temperature gradient and magnetic field are parallel, we find a large contribution to the longitudinal thermal conductivity that is quadratic in the magnetic field strength, similar to the magnetic field dependence of the longitudinal electrical conductivity due to the presence of the chiral anomaly when no thermal gradient is present.},

We consider various minimal lattice models for type II TWS. The simplest time-reversal-breaking band structure, with a pair of Weyl nodes sharing a single electron pocket and a single hole pocket (hydrogen model), exhibits relics of surface Fermi arc states only away from the Fermi energy, with no topological protection. Topologically protected Fermi arcs can be restored by an additional term (hydrogen model) that produces a bulk structure where the electron and hole pockets of each Weyl point are disjoint. In time-reversal-symmetric but inversion-breaking models, we identify nontopological surface track states that arise out of the topological Fermi arc states at the transition from type I to type II and persist in the type II TWS. The distinctions among these minimal models can aid in distinguishing between generic and model-dependent behavior in studies of superconductivity, magnetism, and quantum oscillations of type II Weyl semimetals.},

  abstract = {This article is a brief review of Zeeman spin-orbit coupling, arising in a low-carrier commensurate Néel antiferromagnet subject to magnetic field. The field tends to lift the degeneracy of the electron spectrum. However, a hidden symmetry protects double degeneracy of Bloch eigenstates at special momenta in the Brillouin zone. The effective transverse g-factor vanishes at such points, thus acquiring a substantial momentum dependence, which turns a textbook Zeeman term into a spin-orbit coupling. After describing the symmetry underpinnings of the Zeeman spin-orbit coupling, I compare it with its intrinsic counterparts such as Rashba coupling, and then show how Zeeman spin-orbit coupling may survive in the presence of intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Finally, I outline some of the likely experimental manifestations of Zeeman spin-orbit coupling, and compare it with similar phenomena in other settings such as semiconducting quantum wells.},

  abstract = {We study various thermodynamic and transport properties of a holographic model of a nodal line semimetal (NLSM) at finite temperature, including the quantum phase transition to a topologically trivial phase, with Dirac semimetal-like conductivity. At zero temperature, composite fermion spectral functions obtained from holography are known to exhibit multiple Fermi surfaces. Similarly, for the holographic NLSM we observe multiple nodal lines instead of just one. We show, however, that as the temperature is raised these nodal lines broaden and disappear into the continuum one by one, so there is a finite range of temperatures for which there is only a single nodal line visible in the spectrum. We compute several transport coefficients in the holographic NLSM as a function of temperature, namely the charge and thermal conductivities, and the shear viscosities. By adding a new non-linear coupling to the model we are able to control the low frequency limit of the electrical conductivity in the direction orthogonal to the plane of the nodal line, allowing us to better match the conductivity of real NLSMs. The boundary quantum field theory is anisotropic and therefore has explicitly broken Lorentz invariance, which leads to a stress tensor that is not symmetric. This has important consequences for the energy and momentum transport: the thermal conductivity at vanishing charge density is not simply fixed by a Ward identity, and there are a much larger number of independent shear viscosities than in a Lorentz-invariant system.},

  abstract = {Topological Weyl semimetals (WSM), a new state of quantum matter with gapless nodal bulk spectrum and open Fermi arc surface states, have recently sparked enormous interest in condensed matter physics. Based on the symmetry and fermiology, it has been proposed that WSMs can be broadly classified into two types, type-I and type-II Weyl semimetals. While the undoped, conventional, type-I WSMs have point like Fermi surface and vanishing density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy, the type-II Weyl semimetals break Lorentz symmetry explicitly and have tilted conical spectra with electron and hole pockets producing finite DOS at the Fermi level. The tilted conical spectrum and finite DOS at Fermi level in type-II WSMs have recently been shown to produce interesting effects such as a chiral anomaly induced longitudinal magnetoresistance that is strongly anisotropic in direction and a novel anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we consider the anomalous Nernst effect in type-II WSMs in the absence of an external magnetic field using the framework of semi-classical Boltzmann theory. Based on both a linearized model of time-reversal breaking WSM with a higher energy cut-off and a more realistic lattice model, we show that the anomalous Nernst response in these systems is strongly anisotropic in space, and can serve as a reliable signature of type-II Weyl semimetals in a host of magnetic systems with spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry.},

  abstract = {In the presence of parallel electric and magnetic fields, the violation of a separate number conservation laws for the three-dimensional left- and right-handed Weyl fermions is known as the chiral anomaly. The recent discovery of Weyl and Dirac semimetals has paved the way for experimentally testing the effects of chiral anomaly via magnetotransport measurements, since chiral anomaly can lead to negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) while the transverse magnetoresistance remains positive. More recently, a type-II Weyl semimetal (WSM) phase has been proposed, where the nodal points possess a finite density of states due to the touching between electron and hole pockets. It has been suggested that the main difference between the two types of WSMs (type I and type II) is that in the latter, chiral-anomaly-induced negative LMR (positive longitudinal magnetoconductance) is strongly anisotropic, vanishing when the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of tilt of Weyl fermion cones in a type-II WSM. We analyze chiral anomaly in a type-II WSM in a quasiclassical Boltzmann framework, and find that the chiral-anomaly-induced positive longitudinal magnetoconductivity is present along any arbitrary direction. Thus, our results are pertinent for uncovering transport signatures of type-II WSMs in different candidate materials.},

In this model it is extremely easy to explain which properties of the theory are responsible for the quantum anomaly, and the physical nature of the phenomenon is elucidated. The second part is devoted to the derivation of the anomaly relations within QCD. The subtle question of the multiloop corrections is discussed. The third part presents applications. Starting from the chiral and scale anomalies we obtain low-energy theorems which lead, in turn, to predictions for observable processes. In particular, a proof based on first principles is given of the existence of massless pions, the amplitudes are calculated for the conversion of gluon operators into pions, which can be measured experimentally. Other practical problems are also considered, the solution of which turns out to be possible due to anomalies.},

We critically examine this idea, and argue that the thermogravitational Hall effect is more complicated than its familiar analog. A conventional Hall current is generated by a uniform electric field, but computing the flux from the gravitational Chern-Simons functional shows that gravitational field gradients—i.e., tidal forces—are needed to induce an energy-momentum flow. We relate the resulting surface energy-momentum flux to a domain-wall gravitational anomaly via the Callan-Harvey inflow mechanism. We stress that the gauge invariance of the combined bulk-plus-boundary theory ensures that the current in the domain wall always experiences a “covariant” rather than “consistent” anomaly. We use this observation to confirm that the tidally induced energy-momentum current exactly accounts for the covariant gravitational anomaly in (1+1)-dimensional domain-wall fermions. The same anomaly arises whether we write the Chern-Simons functional in terms of the Christoffel symbol or in terms of the spin connection.},

For thick films that contain an integer number of half wavelengths, we find that the Faraday and Kerr effects are both quantized at integer multiples of the fine structure constant. For TI films with bulk parallel conduction, we obtain a criterion for the observability of surface-dominated magneto-optical effects. For thin samples supported by a substrate, we find that the universal Faraday and Kerr effects are present when the substrate is thin compared to the optical wavelength or when the frequency matches a thick-substrate cavity resonance. Our theory applies equally well to any system with two conducting layers that exhibit quantum Hall effects.},

Very recently, a number of materials (MoTe\$\_2\$, LaAlGe and WTe\$\_2\$) have been identified as hosts of so-called type-II Weyl fermions whose dispersion is so strongly tilted that a Fermi surface is formed, whereby the Weyl node becomes a singular point connecting electron and hole pockets.

  abstract = {We investigate how tilting affects the off-diagonal, dissipationless response of a pair of chirally imbalanced Weyl cones to various external perturbations. The pair of chirally imbalanced Weyl cones can be described as a chiral electron fluid, that can flow with a velocity field that contains vorticity. Upon applying an external magnetic field, we obtain the so-called magnetovortical linear-response matrix that relates electric and heat currents to the magnetic field (chiral magnetic effect) and the vorticity (chiral vortical effect). We show how this response matrix becomes anisotropic upon tilting the cones and determine its nonanalytic long-wavelength behavior, as well as the corresponding ac response. In addition, we discuss how the tilt dependence of the electronic (or density-density) susceptibility introduces anisotropy in the dispersion relation of the soundlike excitations in the fluid of chiral fermions, which are known as chiral magnetic waves. In the case of an externally applied electric field and a temperature gradient, we find a Hall-like response in the electric and heat current density that is perpendicular to both the tilting direction and the perturbations. As the tilting direction forms a time-reversal symmetry breaking vector, a nonzero (heat) orbital magnetization manifests itself. We calculate the magnetization currents microscopically and elucidate how to subtract these contributions to obtain the transport currents.},

This presentation was held live on September 22, 2021 as part of the theoretical physics colloquium series hosted by Prof. Igor Shovkovy at the Arizona State University. The series features high-quality interactive presentations on current advances in theoretical physics by active researchers in the field of theoretical physics. Abstract for this presentation: The recognition and proper description of quantum anomalies have been a pillar in the construction of quantum field theory. Aside from the axial anomaly, the consequences of quantum anomalies involving the spacetime geometry as mixed axial-gravitational or conformal anomalies, are more difficult to test in the high energy context. The advent of Weyl semimetals in 2015 opened new ways to realize and evaluate anomaly related transport phenomena. In this talk I will describe novel response functions associated to various anomalies in Dirac matter.}

  abstract = {Spin field-effect transistors (SFETs) based on the Rashba effect could manipulate the spin of electrons electrically, while seeking desirable Rashba semiconductors with large Rashba constant and strong electric-field response, to preserve spin coherence remains a key challenge. Herein, we propose a series of 2D Rashba semiconductors with two-atom-thick buckled honeycomb structure (BHS) according to high-throughput first-principles density functional theory calculations. BHS semiconductors show large Rashba constants that are favorable to be integrated into nanodevices superior to conventional bulk materials, and they can be fabricated by mechanical exfoliation or chemical vapor deposition. In particular, 2D AlBi monolayer has the largest Rashba constant (2.77 eVÅ) of all 2D Rashba materials. Furthermore, 2D BiSb monolayer is a promising candidate for SFETs due to its large Rashba constant (1.94 eVÅ) and strong electric field response (0.92 eÅ2). Our designed 2D-BiSb-SFET shows shorter spin channel length (42 nm with strain) than conventional SFETs (2-5 μm).},

The energy tilt tends to squeeze the Landau levels (LLs), and, for a type-II Weyl node, there always exists a critical angle between the B field and the tilt, at which the LL spectrum collapses, regardless of the field strength. Before the collapse, signatures also appear in the magneto-optical spectrum, including the invariable presence of intraband peaks, the absence of absorption tails, and the special anisotropic field dependence.},

  abstract = {Broken symmetry and tilting effects are ubiquitous in Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Therefore, it is crucial to understand their impacts on the materials' electronic and optical properties. Here, using a realistic four-band model for WSMs that incorporates both the symmetry breaking and tilting effects, we study its Landau quantization and the associated magneto-absorption spectrum. We show that the Landau levels in tilted Weyl bands can be obtained by considering a non-tilt Hamiltonian through Lorentz boost. However, broken symmetry effects can generate an additional term in the Hamiltonian, which equivalently leads to band reconstruction. Our work provides a more realistic view of the magnetic field response of WSMs that shall be taken into account in relevant future device applications.},
